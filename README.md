## vllm-coco-captioner

This project performs automatic caption generation for COCO dataset images using a multimodal vision-language model. The generated captions are stored in a structured SQLite database for easy retrieval and evaluation. The system runs efficiently with **vLLM**, enabling fast inference even on a standard Colab T4 GPU.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The system processes COCO dataset images and automatically generates captions using a vision-language model. The generated outputs are stored in a structured SQLite database.
It uses vLLM to run a multimodal model efficiently.

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Environment Setup
Set up a local environment with vLLM to run the vision model fast because vLLM utilizes  **PagedAttention**, a memory management technique that significantly reduces memory waste accelerates inference. This allows smooth execution on limited-memory GPUs such as **T4**.

### 2. Model Initialization
Load a vision-language model (**Qwen2-VL**) that can understand images, not just text.

### 3. Image-to-Text Generation
Each COCO image is passed to the model, and a descriptive caption is automatically generated for it.

### 4. Database Storage
Captions are saved into a **SQLite** database containing:
- Image ID
- COCO image link
- Generated caption

In this project i used **VLM** because it  can interpret both images and language.A standard LLM can only process text.We are working with both images and text  VLMs are the correct fit.


## 🧠 Why Qwen2-VL-2B?

Qwen2-VL is a multimodal model capable of processing both images and language. Larger models like Qwen2-VL-7B or Llama Vision could work too, but they need much more GPU and are not optimal for standard Colab. The 2B model fits perfectly in a standard Colab T4 GPU.



## 🗄️ Why SQLite?

SQLite is used because it is serverless and lightweight.
It creates a local .db file that is easy to export,
which is perfect for a Colab environment compared to setting up a heavy MySQL server."

## 📊 Results
The system successfully:
- Generated coherent captions for COCO images
- Stored them in a structured SQLite database
- Operated efficiently using **Qwen2-VL-2B** with **vLLM** on a T4 GPU
